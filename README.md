Checklist

Run through the Setup Setups and get your project ready to begin work.
Review the Resources outlined below - be sure to have relevant documentation and references open while you develop!
NOTE:  Ideally, all of your code will be inside of functions. The Lists that store your trip options can be at the top of their file outside of functions, but everything else should be inside functions!

###
Setup Steps
Create a GitHub repository on GitHub. Remember to use a Python .gitignore and add a README!
Clone your repository down to your computer (referring to the Code Demo – Source Control video would be helpful here!) 
Create your project in Visual Studio Code and move the invisible .git folder and README file to the folder where your project is located.
Make a test commit and check your repository to be sure the content has been updated!
Start coding the program first by going from the top of the user stories and working down. Decide how you will:
Store the trip options for destinations, restaurants, transportation, and entertainment each in their own List (this would be good to place at the top of the file)
Set up a Dictionary to store each randomly selected option.
Get a random element from each of those sets of options. We recommend declaring variables for a random destination, restaurant, transportation, and entertainment
Display the initial random trip to your user
Prompt the user to see if they are satisfied
If not, find out which trip feature they want to change and randomly select a new feature.
Keep doing this process until the user is satisfied with the trip
Display the completed trip to the console.
